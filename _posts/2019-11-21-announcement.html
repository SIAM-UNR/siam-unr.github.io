<p>
We will be holding our opening meeting on <b>December 5, 3:30 - 6:00 in Mackay Science 215</b>.  This meeting will introduce new SIAM members to SIAM as an organization, 
  will feature a plenary talk from Dr. Marylesa Howard, applied mathematician and supervisor at the Nevada National Security Site, and will have a reception with food.
  Dr. Howard will also deliver the colloquium for the Department of Mathematics and Statistics on December 5, please see the

  <b>Title:</b><br>
  The Science of Nuclear Security</br>
  <b>Abstract</b><br>
  The Department of Energy (DOE) employs scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians to work on problems ranging from renewable energy 
  resources to global climate change. However, unbeknownst to many people is the fact that the DOE is also the nation’s overseer of nuclear non-proliferation,
   nuclear emergency response, and nuclear power for the U.S. Navy. Furthermore, the DOE also oversees our nuclear weapons program, where the safety, security, 
  and reliability of our nuclear stockpile are governed through scientific modeling, simulation, and experimentation, and decisions about the nuclear stockpile 
  program are driven by data analysis. In light of this, it is imperative that analysis methods be mathematically justifiable, the data obey the assumptions of 
  the method, and the information extracted from each diagnostic’s data be useful and relevant to the questions posed. Statistical methods are absolutely necessary 
  in the analysis of data from each diagnostic to estimate quantities of interest and to help us understand corresponding uncertainties. In this presentation, some 
  of the scientific research interests of the DOE will be highlighted, including work of Postdocs, Graduate students, Co-Op students, and summer interns, with a 
  focus on measurement diagnostics and analysis for subcritical experiments in 
  support of the Stockpile Stewardship Program at the Nevada National Security Site, the nation’s premier explosives laboratory.
