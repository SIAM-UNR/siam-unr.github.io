Faculty members and graduate
students from the department of
mathematics and statistics stepped
away from their projects on Thursday,
December 5th, to take part in
SIAM&amp;UNR's opening meeting.
Attendees enjoyed an outstanding
plenary talk "The Science of Nuclear
Security" delivered by Dr. Marylesa
Howard, a member at the Nevada
National Security Site and recipient of
the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and
Engineers(PECASE).
</p>
<p>
In her talk, Dr. Howard explained her
organization's role in the nation's
overseer of nuclear non-proliferation,
nuclear emergency response, and
nuclear power for the U.S. Navy. She
shed light on the imperative that
analysis methods be mathematically
justifiable, the data obey the
assumptions of the method, and the
information extracted from each
diagnostic's data be useful and
relevant to the questions posed.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, she explained the
necessity of statistical methods in the
analysis of data from each diagnostic
to estimate quantities of interest and
to help understand corresponding
uncertainties. Dr. Howard also
brought out the scientific research
interests of the department of energy,
focusing on the significant work of
Postdocs, Graduate students, Co-Op
students, and summer interns.
After the presentation, attendees
enjoyed the food and refreshments
whiles exchanging ideas and
opportunities in the world of data
science. Pictures were taken, and
networking connections were made.
Some prospects of collaboration
between UNR and NNSS were also
made.

  More events will be held in the new year.
  We will plan a business meeting in the early Spring Semester, as well as
  a miniworkshop later in the semester.  Details will be posted here in the upcoming weeks.
